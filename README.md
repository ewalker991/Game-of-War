### Game of War
This is a Javascript focused application for executing a card game of War. 
This was made in mind to be played in the console of your web browser in the inspector window. 

However, you'll find that it's not quite complete. I've had my own struggles with making it work correctly, but I'll get there eventually.

For now, merely open the html doc in your browser, open the inspector, and refresh it a few times to see how it changes.
